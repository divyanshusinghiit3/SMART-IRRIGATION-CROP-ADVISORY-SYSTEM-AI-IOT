# SMART-IRRIGATION-CROP-ADVISORY-SYSTEM-AI-IOT

This project, Smart Irrigation & Crop Advisory System, is designed to help farmers optimize water usage and improve crop yield using AI + IoT technologies.

Problem

  Farmers often face over-irrigation or under-irrigation due to lack of real-time soil and weather data. Agricultural advice is often inaccessible because of technical language barriers, leading to water wastage,   higher costs, and reduced yields.

Solution

Our system integrates:

  Soil moisture & nutrient (NPK) sensors for real-time soil health monitoring

  Weather API integration for localized forecasts

  AI models to generate simple, personalized irrigation and crop recommendations

  OpenAI APIs for language translation and voice-based delivery in local languages via WhatsApp, SMS, or calls

Features

  Smart irrigation alerts (e.g., “Soil moisture low; irrigate wheat field for 2 hours tomorrow morning”)

  Rain prediction-based irrigation optimization

  Crop advisory based on soil nutrient data

  Multi-language text and voice support for farmers with low literacy

Impact

  25–50% water savings by preventing over-irrigation

  15–20% increase in crop yield through targeted advice

  Lower electricity costs by reducing unnecessary pump usage

  Improved farmer income and sustainable agriculture practices

Roadmap

  Prototype – Arduino/Raspberry Pi + sensors + weather API + WhatsApp integration

Pilot Testing – with local farmer groups to refine the system

Scaling – partnerships with agri-tech startups and government to expand across crops and languages
